            One of my biggest inspirations for learning, is all the people who teach me. Whether it be my parents, teachers, mentors, friends or family, the knowledge I gain from everyone makes me want more. The things we learn are like pieces of peoples experiences, gifted to us in whatever form it comes in to help us navigate our life as efficiently and educated as possible. I've always thought that one of the best things you could do for someone, is doing anything that makes their life easier. If the knowledge passed to me could do that for someone in the future, I want as much of it as possible.

            In many ways my inspirations have pushed me to succeed. If I wanted to help the most people possible I'd need to succeed. Whatever is I end up doing,being my best at is the most important part. All the little tricks, hacks and methods I've learned in my life are what help me be my best. All with the end goal of success. Success in my career, in my relationships, in life as a whole. My desire to learn, influenced by the people in my life has given me the drive to win at life!
