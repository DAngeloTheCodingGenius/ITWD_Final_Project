          <h1>What part of IT are you interested in, and what motivates you in reaching those interests?</h1><br>
          Software Development and Cybersecurity are my most desirable options in terms of career choice. I think this internship has given me a great look at Web Development as a another option as well. In regards to my motivation, money is definitely the most powerful but, when doing something you truly love doing the potenial fulfillment and overall happiness is plenty more reason to keep striving.

          <h1>Based on your internship, what would you like to learn next?</h1><br>
          Because this internship only had enough time to give us a very basic understanding of web development, I'd like to learn all the fundamentals of html and css. Then, of course, I want to begin learning javascript and more advanced techniques and methods of web development.

            <h1>What about this internship motivates you more? </h1><br>        
                The challenges, I've always thought that the difficulty and abundance of problems that needs solving were the most fun part of coding. As I learn more, I know even more challenges will arise and that makes me want to learn as much as I can, as fast as I can!
